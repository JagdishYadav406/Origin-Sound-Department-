# OSD Web Edition progress

## 2026-10-11 — Web-first continuation

- User clarified the intended deliverable is the OSD web version, not the APK.
- Created dedicated `web-edition` branch from main to isolate web work from Android changes.
- Added preserved standalone OSD source as `web/index.html`.
- Added local-file metadata preflight before full compressed-file read/decode, conservative memory estimate, and post-decode estimate. Rejected replacements retain the previously loaded source.
- Added static-safety tests and inline JavaScript syntax CI check.
- Added a GitHub Pages workflow that verifies the web app and deploys `web/` only after changes reach main.
- Current features: four-track local mixing, gain/offset/trim/fades, master trim, stereo WAV render, project JSON save/load, evidence report.
- Known gaps: dialogue separation, EQ/dynamics/limiter, LUFS, standards-compliant true-peak, video muxing. Do not describe as the complete autonomous OSD department.
- Runtime status: browser/device operation is NOT VERIFIED. Earlier Chromium attempts were blocked by the session environment. No physical-device pass claimed.


## 2026-10-11 — Release preparation correction

- Preserved the Android repository's root README; web-specific instructions are in `web/README.md`.
- CI test invocation runs the test file directly to avoid package-name collisions.
- Pages configuration requests enablement explicitly; deployment remains contingent on workflow success.
